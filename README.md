# opencode-landstrip

Landlock-based sandboxing for [opencode](https://opencode.ai/) using
[`landstrip`](https://github.com/jarkkojs/landstrip).

## Install

Add the plugin to `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["opencode-landstrip"]
}
```

Add the TUI entrypoint to `tui.json` if you install or configure the plugin
manually:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["opencode-landstrip/tui"]
}
```

`opencode plugin install opencode-landstrip` configures both entrypoints.

This installs `opencode-landstrip` and its `@jarkkojs/landstrip` dependency, which
includes platform-specific native binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

On unsupported platforms the plugin loads but leaves sandboxing disabled.

## Configure

Create `.opencode/sandbox.json` in a project or
`~/.config/opencode/sandbox.json` globally. Project config takes precedence and
array fields are merged with global/default values.

See [`sandbox.json`](./sandbox.json) for a starter config.

## Behavior

The plugin wraps opencode's AI `bash` tool in `landstrip`, routes proxy-aware
network traffic through an allowlist proxy, and blocks read/write tool access
outside configured filesystem allowlists. The default policy is strict: network
access is off unless domains are allowed, reads are limited to the project,
`~/.gitconfig`, and `/dev/null`, and writes are limited to the project and
`/dev/null`.

Run `/sandbox` in the TUI to inspect the active sandbox configuration.

When OpenCode asks for a sandboxed permission, the TUI plugin adds choices to
allow once, allow for the session, persist for the project, persist globally, or
reject. Project approvals are written to `.opencode/sandbox.json`; global
approvals are written to `~/.config/opencode/sandbox.json`.

OpenCode's current plugin API allows wrapping AI `bash` tool calls, but does not
allow a plugin to replace manually typed shell-mode commands with a landstrip
wrapper. Those commands can still receive the proxy environment from OpenCode,
but they are not process-sandboxed by this plugin.

## Disable

Set `enabled` to `false` in `sandbox.json`, or pass plugin options:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": [["opencode-landstrip", { "enabled": false }]]
}
```
